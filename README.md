# Shopping List
This is a simple Webapp designed to help the user keep track of a shopping list. Users can log into their own account to delete and update their list as they go. 
## Features
### Features to still implement

* Google Auth- I tried to use Google Auth which I have never used before but unfortunately I just keep getting errors with my code so I decided to use an alternative method to enable me to move on with the project and use my time more efficently. 
* CheckBox Function - So users could tick off what items already been got.
